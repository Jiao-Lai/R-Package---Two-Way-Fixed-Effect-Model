\title{A package which can perform fixed effect model and robustness test.}
\description{
`gssquery` is a package for final project of stats 290. This package can be used to perform fixed
 effect model and robustness tests. GSS data is included to run example of the effect of US
 presidential elections on household happiness. Robustness tests such as event study, leave one out
 falsification exercise, treatment re-shuffling are also provided.
}
\details{
The package provides 9 functions:
* [`GetCleanLmData`][GetCleanLmData()] which selects variables from data `GSS` and clean the data.
* [`Analysis.lm`][Analysis.lm()] which runs linear regression of fixed effect model for given data.
* [`LagEffect`][LagEffect()] which examines if there is any lag effect of the main results.
* [`LeadEffect`][LeadEffect()] which examines if there is any lag effect of the main results.
* [`PlaceboLOT`][PlaceboLOT()] which examines falsification exercise of leave one out to check the subset sensitivity of main results.
* [`GetAttributes`][GetAttributes()] which returns all attributes in given data.
* [`gssquery`][gssquery()] which returns attributes of user interest in a given data..
* [`PlotAttributes`][PlotAttributes()] which returns the bar plot or mean value by group of an attribute of user interest.
* [`PlaceboTSReshuffle`][PlaceboTSReshuffle()] which tests if the main effect is sensitive to treatment re-shuffling.
The source code of the package further demonstrates:

* [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) syntax in documenting functions, including references to functions and data within the same package and from other packages using the [`roxygen2` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html)
* Including a data set [`GSS`] as part of the package
* Importing functions from other packages using `importFrom` directives
* Use of [utils::globalVariables()] to get around warnings produced when checking the package, something that happens a lot when using [ggplot2::ggplot()], for instance.
