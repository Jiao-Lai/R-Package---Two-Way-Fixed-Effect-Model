\title{Placebo test: leave one out.}
\usage{
PlaceboLOU(data, y, x, FE, out)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data containing variables to be analyzed, default is GSS.}

\item{y}{variable containing outcome variable in data.}

\item{x}{variable containing treatment status in data, has to be indicator having two levels.}

\item{FE}{fixed effects.}

\item{out}{variable specifing groups.}
}
\value{
A data frame of coefficients from re-examined linear regression, and
corresponding p value.
}
\description{
This function executes a leave one out falsification exercise on the effect of x on y.
Specifically, observations can be seen as groups by `out`. The total sample will be removed one group
at a time, and then the main analysis is re-examined.
This exercise tests if the main results are sensitive to certain subset of data.

\examples{
data(GSS)
LmData <- GetCleanLmData (GSS,'happy.score', 'election', 'year', 'age', 'income')
PlaceboLOU(LmData,'happy.score','election','year','year')
