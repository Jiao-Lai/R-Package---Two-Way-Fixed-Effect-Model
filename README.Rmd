Stats 290 Final Project: gssquery
Author: Jiao Lai SUID# 06406648

Proposal of the package:
1. What is your package trying to achieve?  Who is it aimed at?

```q1

1.  Querying.  The package will enable users to query the General Social Survey (GSS) data from http://gss.norc.org containing data on contemporary American society. The users could query certain attitudes, behaviors, and attributes.

2.  Visualization.  The package will also provide tools to
visualize the trends of variables of interest, such as age, ethnic, happy, income.

3.  Analysis.  It will also include functions to analyze
if 1) the level of happiness differs in election years vs non_election years, 2) if the level of happiness differs in election years vs re-election years, 3) if there is any lead or lag effect of the above relationship.

The package is aimed at research institutions, analysts and sociologist, politicians.

```

2. Briefly describe the background if that's not obvious.  What field
   or area of interest is it related to?  (Just briefly, in a paragraph
   or two, maximum.) References, including web references, are welcome
   where available.

```q2

Political uncertainty like presidential election is broadly documented to affect economic activities, and firm behaviors. This package is inspired by the idea that political uncertainty may also have effect on individuals/households, like happiness. New policies are generally accomopanied with the on board of new presidents. The policies will harm some people while benefit some others. 
```

3. Provide one or two use cases; that is, in a sentence or so say how
   you see someone using the package.

```q3

Sociolgogists will query the R package for attributes of interest. The queries will allow them to pass arguments.

Scientists can also visualize the trends of variables they are interested.

Scientists will also be able to utilize the analytical functions to
discover assocations between presidential election and household happiness.

Politicians can utilize the analytical functions to discover the above associations and take actions to reduce the negative effect (if any) of presidential elections.

```

4. If you can, list the main functions or other software you plan on
   including.  No need to implement anything now, but you should have
   an idea.

```q4

The R package will provide the following functions: reading,
writing, and cleaning data, creating graphs and visualizations, running parameterized queries against datasets, providing for download
capabilibities of both data and graphics. The R package will also
provide functions for deeper analysis by the user.

```
